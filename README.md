## Introduction

This project is built using Flutter and follows the GetX state management solution for efficient and scalable application development. The folder structure is inspired by the GetX folder structure, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.

## Features

- **GetX Folder Structure**: we use getx folder structure. For more details, refer to the [GetX documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/get).

- **Reusable Widgets**: A dedicated `widgets` folder has been added to the project. This folder contains all reusable widgets, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Naming Conventions**: The project follows standard Flutter naming conventions for clarity and consistency. This includes using lowercase letters for route names, e.g., `/signin`.

- **Assets Organization**: The `assets` folder is organized by categories such as `car`, `home`, `gadgets`, etc., to facilitate easy access and management of UI testing images.
